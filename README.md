# Bike_sharing_pattern_detection
## UDACITY Deep learning Nano degree coursework

In this project, we detect the supply-demand gap of Bikes using a Deep Neural Network. The project focused more on building the Neural Network from scratch to help develop a better understanding, instead of using a library such as pytorch.
